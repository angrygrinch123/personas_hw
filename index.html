              <ul>
                <li>Users' natural instinct is to click or press the top screen or the "sensors" for water</li>
                <li>Users hesitate and start to fiddle with the cup/watter bottle to trigger a non-existent sensor under when pressing the button doesn't work very well</li>
                <li>One user placed the cup under the dispenser and waited for something to happen, only to realize that nothiing happened and thought the machine was broken</li>
                <li>Even after finding out how the hover sensor works, some users give up mid way (i.e. fill their water bottle halfway)</li>

              <li>Do you think the instructions below helped? </li>

            <ul>
              <li>All 3 users have used a contactless water dispenser before at the Nelson but not one that required hand interaction</li>
              <li>Only 1 of the user read the instruction below and was able to find out how to use it while other users preferred trial-and-error because there was so much text</li>
              <li>Users find it uncomfortable and unnatural to use their hand to dispense water because it restricts their movement and induce feeling of silliness in public </li>
              <li>All users think a better design for contactless water dispensing are like the ones in the Nelson where the water bottle is placed below for water, but would use this dispenser again for "the fun of it"</li>
              <li>All three users did not think the dispenser was extremely convenient, because they could not use the dispenser for long periods of time because their arms would hurt, but would be fine to use it just to fill a mug or a water bottle</li>

            and ignores the additional directions written, and keeps clicking on the fountain
            because she is too preocuppied. She usually multi-tasks and responds to emails while filling up water,
            but she can't do that with a interface that requires her 
            to constantly put her hand up.

          <p class="lead">Slow and Steady Sam is a middle-aged, tenured professor at Brown, who sent all his kids to college, and is cruising by 
            and his only concerns are his slightly aching arm from the playing skyrim for a decade and
            trying to figure out where he should be during his sabbatical with his wife (maybe Hawaii). 
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted"> 
            Sam strolls into the CIT kitchen for tea and realizes that there is a set of instructions on the interface. 
            Other than his coffee chat in two hours, he has no other pressing committments - he is <em>after all</em> going on a sabbatical in a month.
            So, sam takes his time and reads through each detail of the interface and smirks when he finds that he has to hold his hand like
            Darth Vader from Star Wars to get water. He winces a little bit because his arm hurts - maybe he should play less Skyrim (or not).
            <b>
              Sam represents users who have time and luxury to read the instruction manuals of an interface and demonstrate users with the most 
              positive kind of experience with the contactless water faucet. He also represents users with a temporary physical limitation 
              that may prevent them from enjoying the full experience, but not to a damaging degree.
